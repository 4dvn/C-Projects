1) Notice that main calls strcmp. What does it mean if strcmp, when passed 2 strings, return 0?
The two strings made up of the same characters. 

2) How would you rewrite the line below, excerpted from main, using keywords if and else? int max = (strcmp(g.level, "debug") ==0) ? 9 :1024;

int max;
If((strcmp(g.level, "debug") ==0))
    max = 9;
Else
    max = 1024;

3) Under what circumstances might the call to sscanf below, excerpted from main, return 2 instead of 1? Scanf(argv[2], " %d %c", &g.number, &c)

If a character is added after the first integer. 


4) What fields in g represent the coordinates at which the user's cursor belongs?
The Y,X variables represent the y,x coordinates of your cursor. 

5) what function (that we wrote) can you call to make the cursor actually appear at those coordinate?
show_cursor(void), makes the cursor appear at g.y/g.x

6) Around what line number in main cound you add additional case statements to handle keystrokes besides N, R, and ctrl-L?
You can start adding additional case statements 
At the end of the last case statement, case CTRL('l'):, around line 188. Before the closing braket }

7)Most n00b and l33t boards have lots of blanks. But how many blanks are in debug #1? In debug #2? And in debug #9?
1, 2, 9 Respectively
